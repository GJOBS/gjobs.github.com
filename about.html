It`s very important to stay up to date and know about all the latest Jobs/Vacancies and thankfully there are many people who are working hard and posting those jobs online so everybody could know about those opportunities :) Now the bitter part is there are lots of websites posting jobs (daily or weekly basis) and they certainly differ. Hence, you can`t find the all/same job(s) on one or another website and you`ve to keep wandering from website to website so you could get updates. What I feel is pain.
